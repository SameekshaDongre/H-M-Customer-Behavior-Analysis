# H-M-Customer-Behavior-Analysis
# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using the H&M dataset from Kaggle. The analysis was performed using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in Google Colab, and key insights were visualized in Power BI for better decision-making.

# Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle’s H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations competition and includes:

1. articles.csv: Metadata about articles (products) available for purchase.
2. customers.csv: Metadata about customers, including activity status and newsletter subscriptions.
3. transactions_train.csv: Purchase history of customers over time.

# Tools & Technologies

1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
2. Google Colab (for data processing & EDA)
3. Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
4. Kaggle API (to fetch the dataset)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning & Exploration
    
  1. Checked missing values and handled data inconsistencies.
  2. Identified key patterns in customer and sales data.

Key Insights & Visualizations

   1. Sales Channel Distribution: Compared online vs. in-store sales.
   2. Customer Activity Analysis: Segmented active vs. inactive customers.
   3. Fashion News Subscription Trends: Analyzed customer engagement.

# Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created with the following insights:

1. Sales trends over time 📈
2. Top-selling products 🛍️
3. Customer segmentation 👥
4. Online vs. offline sales comparison 🏬
